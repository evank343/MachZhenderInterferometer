This contains all the code I created to analyze the outputs of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer for data both from the SPADs and the spectrometer setup.

For QuTAG analysis (i.e. the SPADs) I would use the QuTAG_di_analysis_template_V2.ipyn file, as the other QuTAG analysis versions are obsolete. The QuTAG_mono_analysis_template.ipyn is especially old so I would still use the file I mentioned for data with a single wavelength as well.
