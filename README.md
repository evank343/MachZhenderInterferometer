This contains all the code I created to analyze the outputs of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer for data both from the SPADs and the spectrometer setup.

For QuTAG analysis (i.e. the SPADs) I would use the QuTAG_di_analysis_template_V2.ipynb file, as the other QuTAG analysis versions are obsolete. The QuTAG_mono_analysis_template.ipynb is especially old so I would still use the file I mentioned for data with a single wavelength as well.

Using the code should be straightfoward. Take care to change all the initialization variables to be appropiate values for each run. Before taking data look into these notebooks and make note of what info needs to be recorded within the initialization variables. The spectrometer timepix analyzation code requires you to also define the regions you wish to analyze, you need to define each region's wavelength, output label, x-coord, x-extent, y-coord, and y-extent. Also, the QuTAG and spectrometer code both require you to choose a start and end time for the data you wish to preform a Fourier transform on (for the QuTAG analysis it comes right after the subtitle "Zooming in and normalizing", for the spectrometer analysis it's more clearly defined under the title "Defining limits on what gets fourier analyzed").
